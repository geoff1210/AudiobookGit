window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From one of the most brilliant military historians of our time, this is the classic biography of Rome's greatest general and the victor over Rome's greatest enemy, Hannibal. </p> <p>Scipio Africanus (236-183 BC) was one of the most exciting and dynamic leaders in history. As commander, he never lost a battle. Yet it is his adversary, Hannibal, who has lived on in public memory. As B. H. Liddell Hart writes, \"Scipio's battles are richer in stratagems and ruses - many still feasible today - than those of any other commander in history.\" Any military enthusiast or historian will find this to be an absorbing, gripping portrait.</p>";
