window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Seven minutes past midnight on March 10, 1945, nearly 300 American B-29s thundered into the skies over Tokyo. Their payloads of incendiaries ignited a firestorm that reached up to 2,800 degrees, liquefying asphalt and vaporizing thousands; sixteen square miles of the city were flattened and more than 100,000 men, women, and children were killed.</p> <p><i>Black Snow</i> is the story of this devastating operation, orchestrated by Major General Curtis LeMay, who famously remarked: \"If we lose the war, we'll be tried as war criminals.\" James M. Scott reconstructs in granular detail that horrific night, and describes the development of the B-29, the capture of the Marianas for use as airfields, and the change in strategy from high-altitude daylight \"precision\" bombing to low-altitude nighttime incendiary bombing. Most importantly, the raid represented a significant moral shift for America, marking the first time commanders deliberately targeted civiliansâ€”which helped pave the way for the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki five months later.</p> <p>Drawing on first-person interviews with American pilots and bombardiers and Japanese survivors, air force archives, and oral histories never before published in English, Scott delivers a harrowing and gripping account, and his most important and compelling work to date.</p>";
