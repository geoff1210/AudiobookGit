window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Called a great book worthy of a great man, this definitive biography of the Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet in World War II is considered the best book ever written about Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. Highly respected by both the civilian and naval communities, Nimitz was sometimes overshadowed by more colorful warriors in the Pacific such as MacArthur and Halsey. </p> <p>Potter's lively and authoritative style fleshes out Admiral Nimitz's personality to help listeners appreciate the contributions he made as the principle architect of Japan's defeat. Following the Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, President Roosevelt named Nimitz the commander of the Pacific Fleet. </p> <p>An experienced and respected leader, Nimitz was also an effective military strategist who directed US forces as they closed in on Japan, beginning in May and June of 1942 with the battles of the Coral Sea and Midway. Nimitz was promoted to the newly created rank of fleet admiral in 1944 and became the naval equivalent to the army's General Dwight Eisenhower. The book covers his full life: from a poverty-stricken childhood to postwar appointments as chief of naval operations and UN mediator, and candidly reveals Nimitz's opinions of Halsey, Kimmel, King, Spruance, MacArthur, Forrestal, Roosevelt, and Truman.</p>";
