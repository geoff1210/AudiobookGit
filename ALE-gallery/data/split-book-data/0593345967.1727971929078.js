window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The third and final book in the Galactic Empire series, the spectacular precursor to the classic Foundation series, by one of history’s most influential writers of science fiction, Isaac Asimov </b></p> <p>After years of bitter struggle, Trantor had at last completed its work - its Galactic Empire ruled all 200 million planets of the Galaxy...all but one. On a backward planet called Earth were those who nurtured bitter dreams of a mythical, half-remembered past when the planet was humanity’s only home. The other worlds despised it or merely patronized it - until a man from the past miraculously stepped through a time fault that spanned a millennium, living proof of Earth’s most preposterous claims. </p> <p>Joseph Schwartz was a happily retired Chicago tailor circa 1949. Trapped in an incredible future he could barely comprehend, the unlikely time traveler would soon become a pawn in a desperate conspiracy to bring down the Empire in a twist of agony and death - a mad plan to restore Earth’s tarnished glory by ending human life on every other world.</p>";
